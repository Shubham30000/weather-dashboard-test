## 📋 Overview

This project features a simple, yet effective weather dashboard designed to dynamically display current weather conditions. It parses static weather data from a `weather.json` file and presents essential information like temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed in a clear, card-based layout.

## ✨ Features

*   **Dynamic Data Display**: Automatically loads and displays weather data (temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed) from `weather.json`.
*   **Responsive Layout**: Utilizes Bootstrap cards for a modern, mobile-friendly, and responsive design.
*   **Intuitive Icons**: Integrates Font Awesome icons to visually represent weather conditions.
*   **Clean Interface**: Provides an easy-to-read and user-friendly presentation of weather information.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: For structuring the web content.
*   **Bootstrap 5**: A powerful CSS framework for responsive layout and styling.
*   **JavaScript**: For dynamic loading and display of weather data.
*   **Font Awesome (CDN)**: For scalable vector icons to enhance the user interface.

## 📦 Setup

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd weather-dashboard-test
    ```
3.  **Open the application:**

## 💡 Usage

Upon opening `index.html` in your browser, the application will automatically fetch the weather data from the `weather.json` file. The temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed will be displayed in their respective sections within the Bootstrap cards.

## 📁 Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the weather dashboard and includes the JavaScript logic for data display.
*   `weather.json`: A JSON file containing the static weather data (temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed).
